        <p class="text-3xl font-normal mt-6 w-5/6">Hey, I’m Danny! I am an aspiring software engineer in Liberia. This is my site on the web, where I document my progress.
           I started learning how to code in 2019 and I’ve been learning since, I think I have
           a career in software engineering so this is me keeping track of my progress, not only for me but anyone who have problem finding a definite path or is just on track too.

        <h1 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Hobbies</h1>
        <p class="text-3xl normal mt-6 w-5/6">There’s a whole world outside learning new technologies and 
        coding. I also love music and writing lyrics for them too, I listen to
        variety of genres, from hip-hop to r n b and alternative pop. And I also
        love video games and I have plans on learning how to make them.
        But above all football has always been a big part of my life and I wish
        one day to make it pro but I don’t how I’m going to do that learning 
        software enfgineering. Just stick around and you’ll see.
